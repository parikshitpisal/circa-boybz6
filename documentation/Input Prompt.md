    - Variable document formats
- Extract and structure key data points including:
    - Merchant details (Business name, DBA, EIN, Address, Industry, Revenue)
    - Funding details (Amount requested, Use of funds)
    - Owner information (Name, SSN, DOB, Address, Ownership percentage)
- Maintain processing status tracking (Processing, Ready, Failed)
- Support webhook integration for real-time updates
- Provide secure document storage and retrieval

### User Capabilities

Users must be able to:

- View all applications and their current processing status
- Access extracted data and original documents securely
- Register and manage webhook endpoints
- Download complete applications via API
- Search and filter applications
- Review and correct extracted data if needed

# HOW - Planning & Implementation

## 3. Technical Foundation

### Required Stack Components

- Frontend: Web-based administrative interface
- Backend: RESTful API architecture
- Storage: Secure document storage system
- Email Processing: Email server integration
- OCR Engine: Advanced OCR system with ML capabilities
- Database: Structured storage for application data
- Integration: Webhook management system

### System Requirements

- Performance: Process applications within 5 minutes of receipt
- Security: Encrypted storage, secure API access, audit logging
- Scalability: Handle 1000+ daily applications
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime, 95%+ OCR accuracy
- Compliance: Data protection for sensitive financial information

## 4. User Experience

### Primary User Flows

1. Application Processing
    - Entry: Email received with attachments
    - Steps: Extract attachments → Classify documents → OCR processing → Data extraction → Status update
    - Success: Structured data available via API/UI
    - Alternative: Manual review for failed processing
2. Webhook Management
    - Entry: Access webhook configuration section
    - Steps: Add endpoint URL → Configure events → Test connection
    - Success: Real-time updates received at endpoint
    - Alternative: Retry mechanism for failed deliveries
3. Application Review
    - Entry: Access application dashboard
    - Steps: View application → Review extracted data → Access documents → Update if needed
    - Success: Verified application data
    - Alternative: Manual data correction

### Core Interfaces

- Dashboard: Application overview, processing status, recent activities
- Application View: Extracted data, document previews, status information
- Webhook Management: Endpoint configuration, testing tools
- Settings: Email monitoring configuration, OCR parameters
- API Documentation: Interactive API documentation

## 5. Business Requirements

### Access Control

- User Types: Administrators, API users
- Authentication: API keys for programmatic access, user credentials for UI
- Authorization: Role-based access control

### Business Rules

- Data Validation: Verification of extracted data against expected formats
- Process Rules: Automatic flagging of incomplete applications
- Compliance: Secure handling of sensitive financial data (SSN, EIN)
- Service Levels: Maximum 5-minute processing time per application

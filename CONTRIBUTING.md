## Introduction

Welcome to the AI-Driven Application Intake Platform! This platform automates the processing of Merchant Cash Advance (MCA) applications through advanced OCR and machine learning technologies. This document provides comprehensive guidelines for contributing to the project.

### System Overview
- Automated email monitoring and attachment processing
- AI-powered document classification and data extraction
- Secure document storage with role-based access control
- RESTful API and webhook integration capabilities

### Architecture Overview
The platform utilizes a microservices architecture with the following key components:
- Frontend: React.js with TypeScript
- Backend API: Node.js
- Document Processing: Python
- Data Storage: PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS S3

## Code of Conduct

### Professional Standards
- Maintain professional communication in all interactions
- Respect diverse perspectives and experiences
- Focus on constructive feedback and solutions

### Inclusive Environment
- Use inclusive language in code, documentation, and communications
- Ensure accessibility compliance in all UI implementations
- Welcome contributors of all experience levels

### Reporting Violations
- Report violations to conduct@dollarfunding.com
- All reports will be reviewed confidentially
- Zero tolerance for harassment or discrimination

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- Git 2.40+
- VS Code (recommended)

### Development Tools Setup
```bash
# Install global dependencies
npm install -g typescript@5.0
npm install -g prettier eslint
pip install black pylint

# Install project dependencies
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```

### Environment Configuration
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure required environment variables
3. Set up AWS credentials for S3 access
4. Configure local database connections

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Start development environment
docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

### Database Setup

2. Create development database
3. Run migrations: `npm run migrate`
4. Seed test data: `npm run seed`

### Testing Environment
1. Configure test database
2. Install test dependencies
3. Run test suites: `npm test`

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
1. Fork the repository
2. Create feature branch
3. Implement changes
4. Submit pull request

### Branch Strategy
- Main Branches: `main`, `develop`
- Feature Branches: `feature/TICKET-brief-description`
- Bugfix Branches: `bugfix/TICKET-brief-description`
- Release Branches: `release/version`
- Hotfix Branches: `hotfix/TICKET-brief-description`

### Commit Guidelines
- Use conventional commits format
- Include ticket reference
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Example: `feat(api): implement document validation #123`

### Pull Request Process
1. Update documentation
2. Ensure tests pass
3. Meet code coverage requirements
4. Obtain required approvals
5. Resolve all review comments

### Code Review Requirements
- Minimum 2 approvals required
- Must pass all automated checks
- Security review for sensitive changes
- Performance impact assessment

### CI/CD Pipeline
Automated checks include:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Security scanning
- Performance tests
- Documentation checks
- Linting and formatting

### Deployment Process
1. Automated staging deployment
2. QA verification
3. Security validation
4. Production deployment approval
5. Automated production deployment

## Security Guidelines

- Encrypt sensitive configs
- Secure logging practices

### Security Review Process
1. Automated security scanning
2. Manual security review
3. Vulnerability assessment
4. Compliance validation

### Incident Response
1. Immediate issue isolation
2. Security team notification
3. Impact assessment
4. Remediation planning
5. Post-mortem analysis
